# Refactor Plan — Bridge, God-Widgets, God-Services

**Status:** Phases 1-8 complete. Refactor implementation complete; PR/review pending.
**Scope:** Decompose 4 Dart god-objects and 3 JS god-scripts that grew during the
`js-extension-bridge-sdk` branch (22 feature commits) into focused modules.
**Goal:** Clean foundation for future feature work; no functional changes.
**Implementation timeline:** ~9-13 days, RFC + 9 implementation phases, split across small PRs.

---

## 1. Why this refactor

The `js-extension-bridge-sdk` branch added 22 feature commits to a working
MVP. Some files accumulated responsibilities well past the project's
"150 lines per class" guideline (`docs/CODE_STYLE.md`):

### Dart god-objects

| File | Lines (before → after) | Touched by |
|---|---:|---|
| `lib/features/chat/widgets/chat_webview_widget.dart` | **1630 → 481** | 6 follow-up commits (sandboxing, audioplayers, periodic lifecycle, command registry, connection profiles, headless engine) |
| `lib/features/extensions/services/extension_post_gen_service.dart` | **1526 → 525** | periodic, afterUser, swipe, panels, image gen, js runner, status tracking, error handling |
| `lib/features/extensions/screens/preset_editor_screen.dart` | **1214 → 1 export / 37 real screen** | permissions, connection profiles, block editor, model fetching |
| `lib/features/extensions/services/js_bridge_service.dart` | 707 → 188 (split into `js_bridge/`) | 8 capability additions, growing ~50-100 lines per new method |

### JS god-scripts

| File | Lines | What |
|---|---:|---|
| `assets/chat_webview/bridge.js` | **2141 → 3 shim / ES modules** | ChatBridgeController, runSandboxedScript, PanelHost, scrollback, settings, gestures |
| `assets/chat_webview/renderer.js` | **1234** | Message rendering, markdown, code highlighting, image embeds |
| `assets/chat_webview/formatter.js` | **443 → 2 shim / ES modules** | ST-macro expansion, text formatting |

### Risk of not refactoring

* Every new feature on the extension surface adds 50-200 lines to the
  existing god-objects. Monblant compat would push `js_bridge_service.dart`
  to 1100+ lines.
* Test coverage of god-objects is forced to mock the entire world.
* Code review on a 1600-line diff is impractical.

---

## 2. Refactor strategy

**Functional behavior is preserved.** No public API changes, no new
features, no test deletions. Every phase is a structural rearrangement
covered by the existing 132 passing tests plus new unit tests for the
extracted modules.

**Constraints:**

1. Each phase must end with `flutter analyze` clean and
   `flutter test <target files>` 100% green.
2. Each phase must preserve the relevant invariants from
   `docs/INVARIANTS.md`, especially INV-EG1-8 and INV-JS1-6 for extension
   generation and JS bridge work.
3. Keep reviewable diffs by separating pure file moves from behavior edits.
   The JS phases may exceed 500 lines of churn because module extraction is
   mostly move churn; those commits must be move-only where possible.
4. Ship as multiple small PRs instead of one large PR:
   `js_bridge_service`, `extension_post_gen_service`, `chat_webview_widget`,
   `preset_editor_screen`, and JS assets.

---

## 3. Phases

### Phase 0.5 — ES module WebView spike (0.5 day)

**Goal:** prove that `type="module"` assets load correctly in the app WebView
before moving `bridge.js`, `renderer.js`, or `formatter.js`.

**Work:**

* Add a minimal temporary module asset imported from `index.html` behind a
  dev-only/static-test-visible hook.
* Verify it loads in the Windows WebView2 target with a manual smoke test.
* Add/update a static asset test so the module entrypoint is covered by tests.
* Remove the spike hook before continuing, unless it is useful as a permanent
  asset-loading guard.

**Gate:** do not start Phase 5-7 until this spike passes. If the spike fails,
keep single-file scripts for this refactor and defer ES modules to a separate
platform-compatibility task.

### Phase 1 — `js_bridge_service.dart` split (1 day) ✅ Done

**Before:** `lib/features/extensions/services/js_bridge_service.dart` (707 lines)
— one class with `_handleGetVariables`, `_handleSetVariables`,
`_handleDeleteVariable`, `_handleExecuteCommand`, `_handleTriggerGeneration`,
`_handlePlayAudio`, `_handleShowToast`, `_handleGenerateText`,
`_handleInjectPrompt`, `_handleUninjectPrompt`, plus the dispatcher.

**After:**

```
lib/features/extensions/services/js_bridge/
  js_bridge_service.dart            (≤150 lines: dispatch + context lookup)
  handlers/
    variables_handler.dart           (get/set/delete + atomic scope methods)
    generation_handler.dart          (generateText + triggerGeneration)
    prompt_injection_handler.dart    (injectPrompt + uninjectPrompt)
    audio_handler.dart               (playAudio)
    command_handler.dart             (executeCommand)
    toast_handler.dart               (showToast)
  capability_resolver.dart          (read/write/delete per scope → capability id)
  permission_gate.dart              (`_requireCapability` extracted)
```

**Pattern:** handlers are grouped by domain to avoid one-class-per-tiny-method
class explosion. Each handler exposes typed methods and the dispatcher in
`js_bridge_service.dart` maps bridge method names to the matching method. The
`JsBridgeContext` carries `(params, context, repos, handlers)` so handlers stay
testable in isolation.

**Test impact:** existing `test/js_bridge_service_test.dart` (13 cases)
keeps the dispatcher contract; add per-domain handler unit tests
(`test/js_bridge/variables_handler_test.dart`, etc.).

**Implemented:** `lib/features/extensions/services/js_bridge_service.dart` is now
a compatibility export. The implementation lives under
`lib/features/extensions/services/js_bridge/` with domain handlers for
variables, generation, prompt injection, audio, commands, and toast. Added
`test/js_bridge/generation_handler_test.dart`.

**Verification:** targeted analyze passed for the extracted bridge files and new
test. Targeted tests passed: `test/js_bridge/generation_handler_test.dart`,
`test/js_bridge_service_test.dart`, `test/play_audio_bridge_test.dart`,
`test/js_bridge_toast_test.dart`, `test/global_message_variables_test.dart`,
`test/trigger_generation_test.dart`, and `test/wired_command_registry_test.dart`
(63 tests).

### Phase 2 — `extension_post_gen_service.dart` → block processors (2 days) ✅ Done

**Before:** one 1526-line service that:

* Walks block chain
* Branches on `BlockType` (infoblock, imageGen, jsRunner, interactive)
* Handles status tracking (`InfoBlock.status` lifecycle)
* Manages image-gen step
* Calls InfoBlockService for infoblocks
* Calls PanelHostService for interactive blocks
* Calls JsEngineService for jsRunner

**After:**

```
lib/features/extensions/services/blocks/
  block_processor.dart              (≤200 lines: walks blocks, dispatches to handler)
  block_handler.dart                (abstract: `Future<void> handle(BlockContext)`)
  handlers/
    infoblock_handler.dart          (LLM → extract → persist)
    image_gen_handler.dart          (LLM agent → Image Gen service)
    js_runner_handler.dart          (headless engine preferred, visual fallback)
    interactive_handler.dart        (LLM → panel host)
  block_context.dart                (session, message, character, persona, previousOutput, etc.)
  block_status_tracker.dart         (InfoBlock status lifecycle, extracted)
```

**Pattern:** keep the abstraction minimal: `BlockProcessor.run(blocks, trigger)`
iterates blocks in order, resolves a handler from `Map<BlockType, BlockHandler>`,
and calls `handler.handle(ctx)`. Status transitions are centralized in
`BlockStatusTracker` so every handler follows the same
`pending → running → done | error | cancelled` flow. Do not introduce a
full chain-of-responsibility framework unless the current behavior needs it.

**Test impact:** existing `test/after_user_dispatch_test.dart` and
chain-filter tests stay; add per-handler unit tests
(`test/blocks/infoblock_handler_test.dart`, etc.).

**Implemented so far:** extracted `BlockProcessor` with filter/order/
`dependsOnPrevious` orchestration into
`lib/features/extensions/services/blocks/block_processor.dart`. Added
`BlockContext` and `BlockHandler` scaffolding. `ExtensionPostGenService._runChain`
now delegates orchestration to `BlockProcessor`. Extracted concrete handlers for
`infoblock`, `imageGen`, `interactive`, and `jsRunner` into `services/blocks/`.
The shared image pixel render step remains in `ExtensionPostGenService` because
`rerunImageOnly()` uses it too; JS execution/fallback helpers also remain there
for now because periodic `runJsBlock()` shares the same headless/visual fallback
semantics. Extracted shared panel update/throttling plumbing into
`BlockPanelUpdater`, placeholder/error/dedupe lifecycle into
`BlockStatusTracker`, and shared image pixel rendering/persistence into
`ImagePixelRenderer`. Extracted message-bound `jsRunner` execution/headless
fallback persistence into `JsBlockExecutor`; extracted periodic headless/visual
fallback execution into `PeriodicJsBlockRunner` while keeping
`ExtensionPostGenService.runJsBlock()` as the public scheduler entry point.
Extracted placeholder preparation, `BlockContext` construction, handler dispatch,
and top-level per-block error wrapping into `SingleBlockRunner`. Extracted
manual image-only rerun validation/status update flow into `ImageOnlyRerunner`,
sharing the existing `ImagePixelRenderer` path.

**Verification so far:** targeted analyze passed for
`extension_post_gen_service.dart`, `services/blocks`, and
`test/blocks/block_processor_test.dart`. Targeted tests passed:
`test/blocks/block_processor_test.dart`, `test/after_user_dispatch_test.dart`,
`test/periodic_trigger_scheduler_test.dart`, `test/periodic_lifecycle_test.dart`,
`test/panel_host_service_test.dart`, and `test/js_engine_service_test.dart` (27
tests) after extracting all four concrete handlers. Additional targeted periodic
runner extraction checks passed for `test/periodic_trigger_scheduler_test.dart`,
`test/periodic_lifecycle_test.dart`, and `test/blocks/block_processor_test.dart`.

### Phase 3 — `chat_webview_widget.dart` → controllers/services (2 days) ✅ Done

**Before:** one 1630-line `ConsumerStatefulWidget` doing WebView setup,
bridge wiring, panel lifecycle, audio lifecycle, swipe handling, periodic
tick consumption, afterUser, theme application, scrollback.

**After:**

```
lib/features/chat/widgets/chat_webview/
  chat_webview_widget.dart          (~480 lines: build, lifecycle delegation)
  chat_webview_bridge_host.dart     (JsBridgeService deps)
  chat_webview_theme_builder.dart   (applyTheme map + color helpers)
  chat_message_sync.dart            (pure message-list diff)
  chat_webview_sync_dispatcher.dart (didUpdateWidget per-field diff)
  chat_webview_ext_block_callbacks.dart (ext-block bridge callbacks)
  chat_webview_callbacks.dart       (user-gesture bridge callbacks)
  chat_webview_panel_refresher.dart (ext-block panel refresh)
  chat_webview_initializer.dart     (one-time bridge init sequence)
  chat_webview_build_listeners.dart (build()-side ref.listen plumbing)
  chat_webview_surface.dart         (InAppWebView widget + Stack)
  ext_block_dialogs.dart            (edit / delete AlertDialogs)
  webview_callbacks.dart            (already separate, no changes)
```

**Pattern:** keep `ChatWebViewWidget` as a thin `ConsumerStatefulWidget` that
owns lifecycle hooks and delegates to focused controllers/services. Avoid
mixins as the primary decomposition mechanism because they hide dependencies
and make `initState`/`dispose` ordering fragile. Cross-controller state goes
through an explicit `ChatWebViewContext` or constructor dependencies.

**Test impact:** controllers are tested in isolation where possible
(`test/chat_webview/bridge_host_controller_test.dart`, etc.). Add one widget
harness test that asserts clean init/dispose ordering. End-to-end behavior is
still covered by the manual `flutter run` smoke test.

**Implemented:** `chat_webview_widget.dart` shrank from **1630 → 481 lines
(-70.5%)** via 10 focused extractions. The widget is now a thin
`ConsumerStatefulWidget` that delegates everything except lifecycle
(`initState` / `dispose` / `didUpdateWidget` / `build`) and a handful of
small bridge proxy methods (`scrollToBottom`, `setSearch`,
`toggleMessageSelection`, `applyIdentity`).

Extracted into `lib/features/chat/bridge/` and `lib/features/chat/widgets/`:

| File | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---:|---|
| `chat_webview_bridge_host.dart` | 309 | Owns the `JsBridgeService` deps (audio, toast, command registry, trigger handler, prompt injection, permission gate) and builds the service on demand |
| `chat_webview_theme_builder.dart` | 100 | Pure `Map<String, String>` builder for the WebView theme + `ChatWebViewThemeInput` snapshot |
| `ext_block_dialogs.dart` | 88 | `promptEdit` / `confirmDelete` AlertDialogs |
| `chat_message_sync.dart` | 169 | Pure diff between previous / current message lists + `chatMessageListsIdentical` helper |
| `chat_webview_sync_dispatcher.dart` | 559 | `didUpdateWidget` diff dispatch (14 branches) + `ChatWebViewWidgetFields` snapshot + `ChatWebViewSyncState` bundle |
| `chat_webview_ext_block_callbacks.dart` | 184 | Bridge callbacks for the inline ext-block panel (run / stop / regen / image-regen / edit / delete) |
| `chat_webview_callbacks.dart` | 137 | Pass-through wiring for user-gesture bridge callbacks (swipe, scroll, edit, image, link, load-more) |
| `chat_webview_panel_refresher.dart` | 83 | Refresh / sync helpers for the inline ext-block panel |
| `chat_webview_initializer.dart` | 250 | One-time bridge init sequence + `ChatWebViewInitInput` snapshot |
| `chat_webview_build_listeners.dart` | 201 | `build()`-side `ref.listen` plumbing (regex, editing, streaming, info-blocks, ext settings/presets) |
| `chat_webview_surface.dart` | 316 | `InAppWebView` widget with the `onWebViewCreated` / `onLoadStop` / `onConsoleMessage` callbacks and the Stack layout |

**Verification:** `flutter analyze` clean (1 pre-existing `throw_of_invalid_type` in
`js_engine_service.dart`, out of scope). `flutter test` 683/689 passing
after the refactor — the 6 failures are pre-existing (`bridge.js` wheel
listener, `styles.css` `overscroll-behavior: contain`, both in upstream
Phase 5 scope). One characterization test (`webview_callback_contract_test.dart`)
was updated to look for `indexWhere` / `launchUrl` / `loadOlderMessages` in
`chat_webview_callbacks.dart` (where the code now lives) instead of in the
widget file.

**Future follow-ups (not blocking Phase 3):** the widget still owns a few
small bridge proxy methods (`scrollToBottom`, `scrollToMessage`, `setSearch`,
`toggleMessageSelection`) that could move into a `ChatWebViewBridgeProxy`.
`applyIdentity` and `_applySessionSwitch` are 20-60 lines each and are
candidates for the same treatment. None of this changes user-facing
behavior.

### Phase 4 — `preset_editor_screen.dart` → Sub-screens (1 day) ✅ Done

**Before:** one 1214-line screen with 6 menu groups, a 580-line
`_BlockEditDialog`, API config selector, model fetcher, profile picker,
permissions toggles, etc.

**After:**

```
lib/features/extensions/screens/preset_editor/
  preset_editor_screen.dart         (≤200 lines: top-level scaffold, navigation)
  sections/
    blocks_section.dart             (list of blocks + add)
    permissions_section.dart        (one SwitchListTile per capability)
    profiles_section.dart           (big/medium/small connection profile mapping)
  block_edit_dialog.dart            (same UX as current _BlockEditDialog)
  widgets/
    api_config_selector.dart        (reusable, used in block editor + elsewhere)
    model_field.dart                (with fetch button)
    block_type_picker.dart
    block_trigger_picker.dart
    profile_picker_sheet.dart
```

**Pattern:** each section is a `ConsumerWidget` with its own state. This phase
is structural only: keep the current dialog UX while extracting it into a file.
A full-screen block editor sheet can be done later as a separate UX PR because
it changes behavior.

**Test impact:** widget tests for each section widget (`golden tests`
optional, smoke tests required).

**Implemented:** the old import path is now a compatibility export and the real
editor lives under `lib/features/extensions/screens/preset_editor/`. The top
level screen is a 37-line scaffold/navigation shell. Blocks, permissions, and
connection profiles are separate `ConsumerWidget` sections. The block edit dialog
keeps the existing dialog UX but moved out of the screen, with reusable API
selector, model field, type picker, trigger picker, and profile picker widgets.

| File | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---:|---|
| `preset_editor_screen.dart` | 37 | Top-level scaffold, missing-preset state, section composition |
| `sections/blocks_section.dart` | 218 | Block list, reorder/add/toggle/edit/delete wiring |
| `sections/permissions_section.dart` | 65 | Capability `SwitchListTile`s and default-deny help text |
| `sections/profiles_section.dart` | 106 | big/medium/small generateText profile mapping |
| `block_edit_dialog.dart` | 710 | Existing block editor dialog UX and save mapping |
| `widgets/api_config_selector.dart` | 103 | Reusable API picker field |
| `widgets/model_field.dart` | 138 | Model text field + fetch/pick flow |
| `widgets/block_type_picker.dart` | 47 | Block type segmented picker |
| `widgets/block_trigger_picker.dart` | 39 | Trigger segmented picker |
| `widgets/profile_picker_sheet.dart` | 52 | Bottom sheet for profile → API mapping |

**Verification:** targeted analyze passed for the extracted preset editor files
and smoke tests. Added `test/extensions/preset_editor_sections_test.dart` with
4 widget smoke tests covering the three sections and the default block editor
dialog; all 4 pass.

### Phase 5 — `bridge.js` → ES modules (3 days)

**Before:** `assets/chat_webview/bridge.js` (2141 lines) — a single IIFE
that holds ChatBridgeController, Sandbox, PanelHost, scrollback,
settings, character rendering tooltips, gestures, periodic dispatch,
afterUser.

**After:**

```
assets/chat_webview/bridge/
  index.js                          (≤100 lines: bootstrap, re-export facade)
  chat_bridge_controller.js         (main controller, registers handlers)
  sandbox_runner.js                 (runSandboxedScript, iframe relay)
  panel_host.js                     (PanelHost class, openPanel/closePanel/postToPanel)
  scrollback.js                     (chat scroll, message list)
  settings.js                       (applyTheme, setMessages, etc.)
  gestures.js                       (swipe, scroll, keyboard)
  periodic_dispatch.js              (subscribe to periodic events from Dart)
  after_user.js                     (subscribe to afterUser events)
  message_renderer.js               (delegates to renderer.js modules)
```

**Loading:** replace the single `<script src="bridge.js">` with
`<script type="module" src="bridge/index.js">` in
`assets/chat_webview/index.html`. Modules export their public surface,
`index.js` wires the public surface to the controller.

**Risk:** ES module loading from Flutter/WebView asset URLs must be verified
on the target WebView implementation before this phase starts.
**Mitigation:** Phase 0.5 gates this phase. If it passes, keep a fallback
`bridge.legacy.js` (the current file) for one release or until platform smoke
tests confirm the module entrypoint is stable.

**Test impact:** add `test/webview_assets_module_test.dart` that asserts
each new module is referenced from `index.js` and that no required asset is
orphaned. Syntax validation should use a static check available in the repo
environment; do not depend on `dart:js_util` in VM Flutter tests.

**Implemented:** `index.html` now loads the chat bridge through
`<script type="module" src="bridge/index.js">`. The old `bridge.js` path is a
3-line compatibility marker and the pre-module snapshot is retained as
`bridge.legacy.js` fallback for this refactor. Bootstrap that previously lived
in the inline script now lives in `bridge/index.js`, preserving construction of
`window.bridge`, `window.Bridge`, the scaled chat wheel listener, and
`onWebViewReady` dispatch.

| File | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---:|---|
| `bridge/index.js` | 34 | Module entrypoint, public re-exports, bootstrap |
| `bridge/chat_bridge_controller.js` | 1029 | Main `Bridge` facade, Flutter transport, message list API, ext-block panel, sandbox runner |
| `bridge/panel_host.js` | 193 | Interactive iframe island lifecycle and `glaze:*` relay |
| `bridge/swipe_gesture_handler.js` | 239 | Touch swipe and guided swipe UI |
| `bridge/interaction_dispatch.js` | 170 | Document click/data-action dispatch |
| `bridge/selection_manager.js` | 122 | Selection mode and selection toolbar |
| `bridge/edit_controller.js` | 88 | Inline edit DOM lifecycle |
| `bridge/gen_timer.js` | 50 | Generation timer display updates |
| `bridge/message_update_batcher.js` | 25 | rAF batching for streaming message updates |

**Verification:** `node --check` passed for every new module. Targeted module
asset tests passed: `flutter test test/webview_assets_test.dart --plain-name
"bridge ES module layout"` and `--plain-name "window.glaze SDK"`. Updated
`test/characterization/bridge_selection_edit_swipe_test.dart` to read extracted
module files; the only remaining failure in that file is the pre-existing
textarea wheel listener assertion. Full `test/webview_assets_test.dart` still
has the same 5 pre-existing wheel/CSS failures called out in the project notes.

### Phase 6 — `renderer.js` → modules (1 day) ✅ Done

**Before:** `assets/chat_webview/renderer.js` (1234 lines).

**After:**

```
assets/chat_webview/renderer/
  index.js                          (public `Renderer` facade)
  message_renderer.js               (main Renderer class)
  markdown.js                       (markdown → safe HTML)
  code_highlight.js                 (```lang fences → highlighted)
  image_embed.js                    ([IMG:GEN] / data-uri rendering)
  message_template.js               (avatar, name, role-specific CSS classes)
  shadow_style.js                   (shadow-root CSS)
  icon_library.js                   (SVG icon constants)
  macros_in_message.js              ({{user}}, {{char}} in body)
```

**Implemented:** `index.html` now loads the renderer through
`<script type="module" src="renderer/index.js">`; the legacy
`assets/chat_webview/renderer.js` path is a small compatibility marker. The
active renderer lives under `assets/chat_webview/renderer/`, with `Renderer`
exported and assigned to `window.Renderer` for existing bridge construction.
`bridge/index.js` imports `Renderer` explicitly to avoid module-scope global
lookup hazards.

| File | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---:|---|
| `renderer/index.js` | 7 | Module entrypoint, public exports, `window.Renderer` compatibility |
| `renderer/message_renderer.js` | 948 | Main `Renderer` class: message DOM, metadata updates, search, animation |
| `renderer/markdown.js` | 102 | Shadow-root writes, inline script execution, details arrow repair |
| `renderer/shadow_style.js` | 140 | Shadow DOM CSS used by message content |
| `renderer/icon_library.js` | 19 | SVG icon constants |
| `renderer/image_embed.js` | 20 | Message image attachment DOM |
| `renderer/message_template.js` | 49 | Role/name/date/status helpers |
| `renderer/code_highlight.js` | 4 | Code-block boundary hook |
| `renderer/macros_in_message.js` | 3 | Formatter boundary hook for message body macros |

**Verification:** `node --check` passed for all renderer modules and the updated
bridge module. `flutter analyze test/webview_assets_test.dart` passed. Targeted
asset tests passed for `renderer ES module layout`, `bridge ES module layout`,
`details/summary arrow`, `renderMessage return type`, `updateMessageContent fast
path`, and `_createGenStat dedup`.

### Phase 7 — `formatter.js` → modules (0.5 day) ✅ Done

**Before:** `assets/chat_webview/formatter.js` (443 lines).

**After:**

```
assets/chat_webview/formatter/
  index.js                          (public `formatText` facade)
  macros.js                         ({{...}} expansion)
  text_format.js                    (italics, bold, code inline)
```

**Implemented:** `index.html` now loads the formatter through
`<script type="module" src="formatter/index.js">`; the legacy
`assets/chat_webview/formatter.js` path is a small compatibility marker. The
active formatter class lives in `formatter/formatter.js`, is exported as an ES
module, and is assigned to `window.Formatter` for compatibility. `bridge/index.js`
imports `Formatter` explicitly to avoid module-scope global lookup hazards.

| File | Lines | Responsibility |
|---|---:|---|
| `formatter/index.js` | 6 | Module entrypoint, public exports, `window.Formatter` compatibility |
| `formatter/formatter.js` | 389 | Main `Formatter` class: placeholder pipeline, markdown-ish formatting, image tags |
| `formatter/text_format.js` | 61 | Glaze custom marker rendering and inline style markers |
| `formatter/macros.js` | 3 | Macro expansion boundary hook |

**Verification:** `node --check` passed for formatter modules and updated bridge
module. `flutter analyze test/webview_assets_test.dart` passed. Targeted asset
tests passed for `formatter ES module layout` and `bridge ES module layout`.

### Phase 8 — Test coverage, docs sync, release gates (1.5 days) ✅ Done

**Implemented:** synced `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § 9 with the extracted Dart block
handlers, `js_bridge/` handlers, and WebView ES module layout. Updated
`docs/CODE_STYLE.md` with concrete decomposition patterns from this refactor.
Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN_EXT_BLOCKS.md`, and `INVARIANTS.md` so they no longer
point at obsolete planning docs or old single-file JS implementation paths.
Restored and refreshed `docs/markdown-markers.md` for the new formatter/renderer
module boundaries.

Added `test/docs_links_test.dart` as a docs guard for:

* no references to deleted obsolete planning docs
* extension docs pointing at `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `refactor_plan.md`
* markdown marker guide pointing at `formatter/formatter.js`,
  `formatter/text_format.js`, and `renderer/shadow_style.js`

**Verification:** `flutter analyze` still has the known pre-existing
`throw_of_invalid_type` in `js_engine_service.dart`, with no new Phase 8 analyzer
issues in touched docs/tests. Targeted docs and asset tests passed; full test
baseline remains unchanged except for known pre-existing WebView asset/selection
wheel/CSS failures documented in this branch.

## 4. Out of scope

* **No new features.** This PR is structural only.
* **No UX changes in structural PRs.** For example, replacing the block edit
  dialog with a full-screen sheet is a separate follow-up UX PR.
* **No public API changes.** All ext-blocks behavior is preserved.
* **No god-object that is < 500 lines is touched.** Examples: the
  `panel_host_service.dart` (already a focused service), the
  `audio_bridge_service.dart` (already small), the
  `command_registry.dart` (already a registry).
* **No new dependencies.** The ES module refactor in Phase 5 uses
  built-in browser support; no bundler (rollup / esbuild) is added.
* **No test deletion.** Existing 132 assertions must keep passing.

## 5. Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `flutter analyze` regressions during controller extraction | Each Phase 1-4 ends with `flutter analyze <target files>` clean. CI gate: 0 new errors. |
| Existing tests break during refactor | Run `flutter test <target>` after every commit. If a test breaks, fix the refactor, not the test. |
| ES modules don't load on a specific platform | Phase 0.5 spike gates Phase 5-7. If it fails, keep single-file scripts and defer ES modules. |
| Controller lifecycle interactions (e.g. dispose order) | Add a `ChatWebViewHarness` test widget that asserts clean init/dispose ordering. |
| Reviewer fatigue on a large PR | Ship as multiple PRs by subsystem. Keep pure moves separate from behavior edits. |
| 9-13 day timeline slips | Each phase ships independent. If Monblant RFC is approved mid-refactor, Monblant work can start on already-refactored modules. |

## 6. Open questions

* **`bridge.legacy.js` fallback duration:** if Phase 0.5 passes, keep the
  fallback for one release or drop immediately after platform smoke tests?
* **Section widgets in Phase 4:** keep them private initially
  (`sections/_blocks_section.dart`) or expose as public now? Default: private
  until a second real consumer exists.
