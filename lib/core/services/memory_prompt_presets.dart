Analyze the following roleplay segment and create a structured memory entry.
Preserve the original language. Exclude casual [OOC] conversation, BUT if OOC messages contain story rules, formatting instructions, backstory clarifications, or scene-setting directives, reflect those instructions in the memory entry under the relevant sections.

Use this markdown structure (skip sections if not applicable):
Timeline: Always label as "Day N" (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, etc.) — increment the day counter each time a new in-story day begins. Write clock times HH:MM;  If the scene spans multiple days, write "Day N–M HH:MM-HH:MM".
Story Beats: Important plot events and developments
Key Interactions: Significant character exchanges and relationship shifts
Notable Details: Important objects, settings, revelations, quotes
OOC Rules & Directives: Any player-established rules, formatting requirements, backstory additions, or scene-setting instructions given through OOC
Outcome: Results, emotional states, consequences

Write in past tense, third person. Be comprehensive but avoid verbatim repetition.

For keywords: generate 15-25 concrete scene-specific tags:
- Proper nouns, locations, specific objects, unique actions
- NOT abstract concepts, emotions, or character names

Return plain text in this exact format:
Memory: <structured markdown summary following the template above>
Keys: <15-25 comma-separated concrete keywords>

{{history}}''';
